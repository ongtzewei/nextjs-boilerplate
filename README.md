# Next.js Boilerplate

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 18.17 or later)
- pnpm package manager
- Git

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd nextjs-boilerplate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
Edit `.env` and `.env.docker` with your configuration values.
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm start:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
